    <p class="govuk-body">Use this service to tell Ofsted what you, as a parent or carer, think about your child’s school.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This service is only for giving feedback about schools. If you have other concerns you can contact the school directly or get in touch with your local authority.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">There are a maximum of 15 questions in the feedback survey and it should take around 15 minutes to complete. You will be able to fill in the survey again if you have more than one child.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">By giving feedback you are helping schools raise standards. It also helps parents and carers make more informed choices about where to send their children.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">All feedback is anonymised and will be read by an Ofsted inspector to help them understand what a school is like. Ofsted also uses this information to make decisions about which schools to inspect and when. By giving feedback you give your consent to Ofsted seeing your responses.</p>
