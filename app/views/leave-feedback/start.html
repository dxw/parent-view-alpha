    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>tell Ofsted what you think about your child’s school</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">By giving feedback you are helping schools to raise their standards plus parents and carers to make more informed choices about where to send their children.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">All feedback is anonymised and will be read by an Ofsted inspector to help them build a picture of the school.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Ofsted also uses this information to make decisions about which schools to inspect and when.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">By giving feedback you consent to your responses being made available to Ofsted.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This service is just for feedback about schools. There is a different service to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/complain-about-school">make a complaint about your school</a> or get in touch with the school directly if you have other concerns.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Completing the feedback survey should take around X minutes.</p>
